# Happy Hygiene App

**Description:**
<br>Nextech hosted a Summer Coding Challenge in 2020. The prompt stated that students needed to identify a global or community health challenge, and solve it by using technology. I decided to create a mobile app called Happy Hygiene using Code.org (JavaScript, HTML, CSS). My app is designed to help solve the challenge that parents face when trying to keep their kids healthy on a day-to-day basis. 

**The Outcome:**
<br>After a very quick 10 weeks, I submitted my project. After Nextech reviewed the submissions, I was awarded First Place for the Intermediate division.
