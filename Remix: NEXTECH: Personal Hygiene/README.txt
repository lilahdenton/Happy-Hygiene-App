# README for Remix: NEXTECH: Personal Hygiene #

This is the README file for the NEXTECH: Personal Hygiene app. It's a great place to write
down some notes about how your app works. For starters, here is some information
about the other files in this folder.

The files in this folder contain everything needed to run my app: 

* `applab/applab.js` - This file contains the applab library, which has all the
  javascript that applab uses to run HH.

* `applab/applab.css` - This file contains some default CSS styling for the app.

* `index.html` - This is the html file that I designed in applab using the
  Design tab. It contains all the buttons, text inputs, and other controls for
  HH. 
  
* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in my
  app that I specified under the Design tab.

* `code.js` - This file has all the JavaScript code. 

* `assets` - This is a directory with all the asset files.
